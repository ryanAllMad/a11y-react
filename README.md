# WAI - ARIA APG PATTERNS - VITEST TESTING SUITE

This project utilizes [Dequeu's Cauldron](https://cauldron.dequelabs.com/) components to set up a Vitest testing suite based on the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Patterns found here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/). I aim to make this a fully comprehensive accessiblity unit testing guide to help you test your patterns for all automation avaialable accessibility tests.
